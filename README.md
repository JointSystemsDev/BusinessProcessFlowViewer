Then you must follow these steps:

# Get required tools

To use Microsoft PowerApps CLI, do the following:

* Install Npm (comes with Node.js) or install Node.js (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 LTS as it seems to be most stable.

* Install .NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack.

* If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of the options below:

  * Option 1: Install Visual Studio 2017 or later.
  * Option 2: Install .NET Core 2.2 SDK and then install Visual Studio Code.
* Install Microsoft PowerApps CLI.

Be sure to update your Microsoft PowerApps CLI to the latest version: 
```bash
pac install latest
```
# Build the control

* Clone the repo/ download the zip file.
* Navigate to ./BusinessProcessFlowViewer/ folder.
* Copy the folder path and open it in visual studio code.
* Open the terminal, and run the command the following command to install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Then run the command:
```bash
npm run start
```
# Build the solution

* Create a new solution folder and open the Developer command prompt.
* Change the directory to the newly created folder in previous step.
* Init the future solution:
```bash
pac solution init --publisher-name someName --publisher-prefix someSolutionPrefix
``` 
* Add the control to your future solution:
```bash
pac solution add-reference --path provide path of control project folder where the pcf.proj is available
``` 
* Build 1/2:
```bash
msbuild /t:build /restore
``` 
* Build 2/2:
```bash
msbuild

* You will have the solution file in SolutionFolder/bin/debug folder!

If you want to change the solution type you have to edit the .cdsproj file:
```bash
Solution Packager overrides, un-comment to use: SolutionPackagerType (Managed, Unmanaged, Both)
  <PropertyGroup>
    <SolutionPackageType>Managed</SolutionPackageType>
  </PropertyGroup>

  ```
